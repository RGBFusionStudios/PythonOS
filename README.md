# PythonOS
This is a basic text based CLI that can be run in any Python 3 IDE without needing to install any extra libraries

Keep in mind that eve though the name is PythonOS, this is not a real OS that you can flash. It is simply a script that when run, acts as a basic command line.
However, you can change the initial setup function on your computer to run this file in a Python3 interpreter upon boot. I would not recommend doing this on your personal computer, as this may result in data loss or preventing you from accessing your PC normally. 
I would suggest that if you choose to do this it is on a single board computer like a Raspberry Pi, where the OS that the Pi is running can be re-flashed to a microSD card.
